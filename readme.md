# Chris's Stand Alone Vim 

This includes the following plugins: 

vim-airline
nerdtree

## Installation
Just clone this project and make it the .vim directory, then run

ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

You also need to install powerline fonts to get the full pretty-ness

## Nice additons
I suggest you use iTerm2 with powerline-shell
